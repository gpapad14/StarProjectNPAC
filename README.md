# Star project with Python - NPAC 2018

This is an application to manipulate astrophysics images uploaded from the ESO Digital Sky Survey (DSS) database. The goal is to display images, computing the background, find and analyze clusters and extract some scientific information from those images. This was a 2-person work and part of the code was given ready (lib_XXX files).
